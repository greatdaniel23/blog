# Behind the Kitchen: Chef's Table Experience

*A note from Executive Chef Marco Bellini*

After twenty years in kitchens from Milan to Tokyo, I've learned that the best meals are not just eaten — they are experienced. This is why we created the Chef's Table.

## The Philosophy

Every dish tells a story. The tomatoes from the coastal farm where I spent childhood summers. The technique learned from a grandmother in Kyoto. The perfectly imperfect plating that speaks to the human hands behind each course.

At our Chef's Table, you become part of that story.

## The Experience

### The Setting
A custom-built table within our kitchen, positioned to see every station while remaining in an oasis of calm. You'll feel the energy of service without the chaos.

### The Menu
No written menu. Each evening is crafted based on:
- What arrived from our farmers that morning
- The season's peak ingredients  
- Your preferences and dietary needs
- A bit of inspiration (and improvisation)

Typically: 12-15 courses over 3-4 hours.

### The Pairing
Our sommelier selects wines not just for the dishes, but for the journey. Expect surprises — a sake with your pasta course, perhaps, or a dessert wine from a tiny producer we discovered last month.
